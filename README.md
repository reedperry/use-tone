This project started out as an experiment with using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to create and control sounds using the WebAudio API, and more specifically, `OscillatorNode`s.
The core piece of this codebase is the useTone hook (is 'Hook' a proper noun deserving a capital H?).
Almost all of the other code here right now is just applying useTone in some different tools for making sound.

It may evolve into some more serious applications depending on how things go.
